# Trello Board App

> The scope of this project was to Design + Build a Trello board.

Trello is a web-based Kanban-style list-making application and workflow visualization tool that enables users to optimize the flow of their work. A basic Kanban board has a three-step workflow: `To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`. Each work item is represented as a separate card on the board to enable users to track the progress of work through the workflow in a highly visual manner.
